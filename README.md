gut
===

Git with more guesswork.

The main goal of the `gut` wrapper script is to "guess" what the user wants
based on the repo's context -- eg. what does commit mean when there are no files
staged?

It's still very early days but hopefully once it's at a state where I can do the
majority of day-to-day git tasks with it I'll figure out if it's actually
helpful

(Yeah I don't really expect anyone other than me to want to use this...)
